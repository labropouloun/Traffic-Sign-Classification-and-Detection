\# Traffic Sign Recognition and Detection



This program focuses on recognizing and classifying traffic signs into 43 categories.  

It uses the YOLO model to detect signs from images or videos and identify their meaning.  

The system is designed to support tasks such as autonomous driving, where understanding traffic signs is essential.  





\## Dataset



German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) and German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDM) from the official website:  

\[Benchmark Datasets](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/index.html)



\- The combined dataset contains more than 50,000 images of traffic signs.  

\- Signs are categorized into 43 classes (e.g., speed limits, no entry, turn directions, children crossing, etc.).  

\- Images vary in size and background, including cropped traffic signs and full-scene images with bounding boxes.
